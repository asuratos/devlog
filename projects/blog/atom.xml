        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So here begins yet another blog. I’ve tried blogging a few times in my life, and I never really ended up sticking to it.
Once in high school as a general blog (as if anyone would want to read that), then later in college, where I tried to write about anime to a more focused audience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither attempt got very far, and both blogs are now lost to the aether.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it just wasn’t for me. Maybe I just didn’t have the right mindset. Maybe it’s just a hard habit to keep.
Either way, let’s hope this one has some legs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
