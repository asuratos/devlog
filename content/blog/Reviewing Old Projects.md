When you start a project like this, you're forced to come face to face with the many failed and abandoned projects left have been left in the past. I'm no exception, and I like to think leaving small projects unfinished is more common than not. It's easy for people to get excited and start something in a moment of passion, but it's much harder to follow through until the end.

Old projects often stay where they are: forgotten and eventually hidden in private repositories, never to be looked at again. But sometimes, when they're found again, they can reignite the passion that gave them birth, and maybe find a second chance at completion.
